When we want to gather information or gain insights, data may not always be available in a complete dataset that is ready for further analysis. In situations where no datasets are available, web scraping can be one solution to obtain a dataset by utilizing websites that we want to extract information from.

Web scraping (also known as web data mining or web harvesting) is a technique for automatically extracting data from web pages using specific software. This technique is used to extract information from various websites, including text, images, audio, video, and other information that can be accessed through the internet.
