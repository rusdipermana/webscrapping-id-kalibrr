# webscrapping-id-kalibrr
In this modul, We will analyze job opportunities in the data field taken from the job information provider website, kalibrr.id, as well as insights gained from the analysis. We will use the Python programming language and supporting libraries such as the web parser library BeautifulSoup, Pandas Library as an analysis tool, matplotlib for visualization, and Jupyter Notebook as a tidy report.

# Conclusion

When we want to gather information or gain insights, data may not always be available in a complete dataset that is ready for further analysis. In situations where no datasets are available, web scraping can be one solution to obtain a dataset by utilizing websites that we want to extract information from.

Web scraping (also known as web data mining or web harvesting) with beatifulsoup is a technique for automatically extracting data from web pages using python languange. This technique is used to extract information from various websites.
